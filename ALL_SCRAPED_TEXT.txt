sufficient gap between the timings of the connecting flights so that there is enough time to
complete the transit formalities, particularly in view of the Covid-19 induced restrictions or
regulations. There have been instances when the students have missed their connecting
flights due to insufficient layover.
(ii) The student should also check the allowed baggage regulations. There may be difference
of baggage allowance in domestic and international flights. Students must carry the
baggage equivalent to the limit of the lower category (domestic / international). In any
case, ICCR will not pay any additional amount on account of excess baggage.

lakhs or equivalent. As per the latest ICCR guidelines, medical insurance is compulsory

opening form and a letter from ICCR's Zonal/Sub Zonal Office/University concerned would be required
recommending immediate opening of bank account at the nearest branch of State Bank of India. Students
should carry with them passport-size photographs for opening the bank account. It is important to note
that student will not be paid any money in cash or otherwise till the bank account is opened. Therefore
student must carry minimum money as advised above to meet initial expenditure. Three months advance
stipend/scholarship through direct bank transfer will be released once bank account is opened and
registered with ICCR.
19. After completing the requisite formalities, student should fill up the Joining Report (JR) in
prescribed Performa and get it duly counter signed by International Student Advisor/Head of Department
of University. The columns related to Tuition fee/other compulsory fees structure for the entire duration of
course in the Joining Report are to be filled in and certified by ISA/HoD of University/Institute. While filling
up the JR, it is advised to fill the details related to date of birth, nationality, course, college details,
registration number etc with utmost care.
20. The Joining Report complete in all aspects should be uploaded on the Gyan Setu App/submitted

valid medical insurance policy are submitted to ICCR Zonal/Sub Zonal Office for smooth release of
stipend etc.
24. After admission, the students are advised to stay in the University/college hostel. However, in
case they choose to stay in private accommodation, they will have to give an undertaking that they
themselves are responsible for their security. If they are staying in University/College hostel, they would
have to adhere to hostel policies. Failing to observe hostel rules will lead to disciplinary action by
University/College. Hostel dues should be settled by students before their departure or discontinuation of
the Scholarship.
5
25. Residential address outside of the enrolled University/Institute should be informed to ICCR Zonal
/Sub Zonal Office and FRRO compulsorily. In case of change of accommodation, the new address should

Date : 29-07-2021
Subject: Gratitude note on the Occasion of the Completion of my Ph.D.
Respected Sir,
I am Anush Gasparyan, was a PhD scholar pursuing Ph.D (Law) at theFacultyofLawUniversityof
Delhi from Armenia , thesis topic ISSUES RELATED TO WORKING WOMEN IN ORGANISED SECTOR: A
COMPARATIVESTUDYOFLAWSANDPRACTICEININDIAANDARMENIAfrom2-261/2015-16/ISD-IItoJune
2021.
With this email I want to express my gratitude toeach one of you at ICCR and Embassy of India in
Armenia for my education and experience in India.
Please see below gratitude note:
"My parents gave me wings, taught me to fly and ICCR provided me sky, with no
limits…
To go, to say goodbye is always hard, it is harder when you leave afamilybehind. ICCRis
the family that I am leaving behind in my second homeIndia.
Role of ICCR in the journey of the achievement of the set goals of a foreign student is
remarkable. ICCR is not a mere an organization providing financial support for educational
purposes, ICCRisastrongpillar ofeach foreignertraveling behindthe dreamsof successand
illumination. Each member of the ICCR family, stands for motivating, encouraging,
comforting, securing, advising throughout stay and education in India.
I express my gratitude to the Embassy of India in Armenia for introducing ICCR and
providing me with the opportunity to continue my educationand discover the beauty of India.
India is the land which carries the earliest history of our kinsman Aryan blood. The land of
great teachings, the land of Ganges, Buddha, the land which faced Mohammedan conquest
and the settlement of Dutch, Portuguese, English and French. The country called Hindustan
was and is a gem in the earth with its unique ability of uniting its nation. India’s biggest
triumph is being true to the values of its own land and religious teachingsthrough centuries.
The secret of uniting such a diverse nation is tolerance, love and respect of others’ way of
life. The country has a beautiful harmonization for every being of its land. This is the place
where every teaching is directedto theartof balancing.Frominsects toplants,fromfishes to
birds, from moon to sun, from rain to wind, fromhumanto animaleverysingleaspectof the
planet has its own significance and importance inthis country.
Going ahead in life, being exposed to a change is a natural phenomenon, however there are
some changes that are shaping our personality and life; hence I am leaving with the most
valuable treasures of India which are wisdom, tolerance, kindness, respect, mindfulness etc.
Qualities gained in India, with the help of ICCR arelife changing.
I fold my hands and bow my head with the immense respect for everyone at the ICCR and
Embassy of India in Armenia for their hard workandcare Ihave beenprovidedduring years
of my education.
Namaste,
Forever yours,
Anush Gasparyan from Armenia

FEEDBACK ABOUT ICCR SCHOLARSHIP
Subject: FEEDBACK ABOUT ICCR SCHOLARSHIP
To: The Director General
ICCR.
From: Satyaveer Sarvesh Koonjah
Undergraduate Scholar (Mauritius)
Respected Sir/ Madam,
Kind Greetings!
I, the undersigned, am writing this mail to you as an account of my marvelous experience
with ICCR from my perspective. Being in a quarantine facility in my home country at present,
this gives me the impetus to reminisce about my studentship in India and thus, leads me to
scribe a concise and genuine note while utilizing my leisure time. I have been an
undergraduate scholar in India, under the African Scholarship Scheme, from 2018 to 2021. I
have been a student of BA (Hons.) Hindi at the Faculty of Arts of Banaras Hindu University
for the past three years.
I vividly remember the exact date of my arrival in Varanasi (26 July 2018), when I was
warmly welcomed by ICCR at the airport and securely transported to a safe accommodation.
ICCR has been extremely helpful at the level of facilitating administrative university
procedures; simultaneously catering me with any support and guidance possible to ease my
path as a scholar in a new place and environment. This indubitably led to a speedy
adaptation process in India. Apart from timely payments of monthly stipends and
contingency/stationery allowances by ICCR Headquarters, I have also been provided with
the opportunity to enjoy semester vacations through excursions organized. Being part of the
ICCR family, I have felt honoured and privileged to commemorate the prestigious legacy
during Annual ICCR Foundation Day celebrations.
On a more serious tangent, ICCR has given all scholars including me, non-financial benefits
such as moral motivation and reassurance to cope with stressful situations during the
alarming covid-19 crisis since 2020. It was encouraging to have dynamic and productive
regional officers in Varanasi, notably Mr. Anurag Singh and Mr. Gautam Neogi, to keep a
regular tab on my well-being and perpetual progress in hostel and university campus. Both
officers have highly aided in completing my procedures efficiently to wrap up my final year
(BA- Year 3, Semester 6) before taking final departure from India and getting on board a
repatriation flight to Mauritius scheduled on 6 May 2021. In addition, it is noteworthy that I
have already received an email from ICCR Headquarters for the purpose of claiming
reimbursement on my return air ticket fares. With a grateful heart, I thank them for their
unflinching assistance under the aegis of ICCR.
In a nutshell, it has been an enriching experience for me over the years as a scholar in
Banaras Hindu University. On the basis of my positive account, I highly recommend budding
scholars to be part of ICCR and withdraw utmost advantage of the experience as a learning
platform. I look forward to staying in touch with ICCR and also, to obtain the precious chance
of being part of the ICCR family again in the unforeseeable future as well.
There has always been a good entente and international partnership between India and
Mauritius for several decades. In the same vein, I seize the opportunity to thank the
Government of India for having supplied vaccines against Covid-19 to Mauritius. I earnestly
wish for the recovery of the indian population battling against the pandemic and also pray for
a safe and healthy India.
Jai Hind!
Long live ICCR!
Long live India-Mauritius partnership!
Thanking you for your cooperation.
Yours faithfully,
Satyaveer Sarvesh Koonjah
ICCR Scholar (2018-2021)
